Question 1: You have bottles of pills, 19 have 1.0 gram pills but one has pills that weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that 
provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

Answer: Put 1 pill from the first bottle on the scale and then increment the number of pills that you put on the scale from each
bottle by 1. So 1 pill from the 1st, 2 from the second, 3 from the third and so on. Then by weighing all the pills you can figure
out which bottle has the heavier pills because depending on the measurement you can tell which bottle is heavier.
